## 1.
It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father\'s wife.
## 2.
And ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.
## 3.
For verily, as absent in body but present in spirit, I have judged already him who hath so done this deed, as though I were present,
## 4.
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together and have the Spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
## 5.
To deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
## 6.
Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
## 7.
Purge out, therefore, the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ, our passover, is sacrificed for us;
## 8.
Therefore, let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
## 9.
I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators,
## 10.
Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.
## 11.
But now I have written unto you not to keep company\--if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner\--with such a one, no, not to eat.
## 12.
For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? Do not they judge them that are within?
## 13.
But them that are without, God judgeth. Therefore, put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
