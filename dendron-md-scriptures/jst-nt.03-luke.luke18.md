## 1.
And he spake a parable unto them, saying that men ought always to pray and not faint,
## 2.
Saying, There was in a city a judge, who feared not God nor regarded man.
## 3.
And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
## 4.
And he would not for a while; but afterward, he said within himself, Though I fear not God nor regard man,
## 5.
Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest, by her continual coming, she weary me.
## 6.
And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.
## 7.
And shall not God avenge his own elect, who cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with men?
## 8.
I tell you that he will come; and when he does come, he will avenge his saints speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?
## 9.
He spake this parable unto certain men, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others:
## 10.
Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee and the other a publican.
## 11.
The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself: God, I thank thee that I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
## 12.
I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I possess.
## 13.
But the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me, a sinner.
## 14.
I tell you, This man went down to his house justified, rather than the other; for everyone who exalteth himself shall be abased; and he who humbleth himself shall be exalted.
## 15.
And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them; but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
## 16.
But Jesus called them and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.
## 17.
Verily, I say unto you, Whosoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.
## 18.
And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
## 19.
Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? None is good, save one\--that is God.
## 20.
Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness. Honor thy father and thy mother.
## 21.
And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
## 22.
Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet thou lackest one thing. Sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor; and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
## 23.
And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful; for he was very rich.
## 24.
And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they who have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
## 25.
For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle\'s eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
## 26.
And they who heard said unto him, Who then can be saved?
## 27.
And he said unto them, It is impossible for them who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God; but he who forsaketh the things which are of this world, it is possible with God that he should enter in.
## 28.
Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all and followed thee.
## 29.
And he said unto them, Verily, I say unto you, There is no man who has left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God\'s sake,
## 30.
Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time\--and in the world to come, life everlasting.
## 31.
Then he took the twelve and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and all things which are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man shall be accomplished.
## 32.
For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on.
## 33.
And they shall scourge and put him to death; and the third day he shall rise again.
## 34.
And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them; neither remembered they the things which were spoken.
## 35.
And it came to pass, as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging.
## 36.
And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.
## 37.
And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passed by.
## 38.
And he cried, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.
## 39.
And they who went before rebuked him, telling him that he should hold his peace; but he cried so much the more, saying, Son of David, have mercy on me.
## 40.
And Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him; and when he was come near, he asked him,
## 41.
Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
## 42.
And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight; thy faith hath saved thee.
## 43.
And immediately he received his sight; and he followed him, glorifying God. And all the disciples, when they saw this, gave praise unto God.
