[[Psalms54|<<-psalms-54]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms56|psalms-56]]alms56|Psalms 56 >>]]
## 1.
Give ear to my prayer, O God, and hide not thyself from my supplication.
## 2.
Attend unto me, and hear me; I mourn in my complaint and make a noise,
## 3.
Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked; for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
## 4.
My heart is sore pained within me; and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
## 5.
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.
## 6.
And I said, Oh, that I had wings like a dove! For then would I fly away and be at rest.
## 7.
Lo, then would I wander far off and remain in the wilderness. Selah.
## 8.
I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.
## 9.
Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
## 10.
Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof; mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.
## 11.
Wickedness is in the midst thereof; deceit and guile depart not from her streets.
## 12.
For it was not an enemy that reproached me, neither he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; if so, then I could have borne it; I would have hid myself from him;
## 13.
But it was a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.
## 14.
We took sweet counsel together and walked unto the house of God in company.
## 15.
Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell; for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them.
## 16.
As for me, I will call upon God; and the Lord shall save me.
## 17.
Evening, and morning, and at noon will I pray and cry aloud; and he shall hear my voice.
## 18.
He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me; for there were many with me.
## 19.
God shall hear and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore, they fear not God.
## 20.
They have put forth their hands against such as be at peace with them; they have broken the Lord\'s covenant.
## 21.
The words of their mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in their heart. Their words were softer than oil, yet they have drawn swords.
## 22.
Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee; he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.
## 23.
But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction; bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.
