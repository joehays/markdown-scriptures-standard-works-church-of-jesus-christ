[[Psalms44|<<-psalms-44]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms46|psalms-46]]alms46|Psalms 46 >>]]
## 1.
My heart is inditing a good matter; I speak of the things which I have made touching the King; my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
## 2.
Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured into thy lips; therefore, God hath blessed thee forever.
## 3.
Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most Mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.
## 4.
And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth, and meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
## 5.
Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the King\'s enemies, whereby the people fall under thee.
## 6.
Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter.
## 7.
Thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness; therefore, God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
## 8.
All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia out of the ivory palaces whereby they have made thee glad.
## 9.
Kings\' daughters were among thy honorable women; upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
## 10.
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people and thy father\'s house;
## 11.
So shall the King greatly desire thy beauty; for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.
## 12.
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor.
## 13.
The King\'s daughter is all glorious within; her clothing is of wrought gold.
## 14.
She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needlework; the virgins, her companions that follow her, shall be brought unto thee.
## 15.
With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought; they shall enter into the King\'s palace.
## 16.
Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.
## 17.
I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations; therefore shall the people praise thee forever and ever.
