[[Psalms130|<<-psalms-130]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms132|psalms-132]]ms132|Psalms 132 >>]]
## 1.
Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; neither do I exercise myself in great matters or in things too high for me.
## 2.
Surely I have behaved and quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother; my soul is even as a weaned child.
## 3.
Let Israel hope in the Lord from henceforth and forever.
