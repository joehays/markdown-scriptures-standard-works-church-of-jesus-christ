[[Psalms119|<<-psalms-119]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms121|psalms-121]]ms121|Psalms 121 >>]]
## 1.
In my distress I cried unto the Lord, and he heard me.
## 2.
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue.
## 3.
What shall be given unto thee? Or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?
## 4.
Sharp arrows of the mighty with coals of juniper.
## 5.
Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!
## 6.
My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.
## 7.
I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.
