[[Psalms2|<<-psalms-2]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms4|psalms-4]]Psalms4|Psalms 4 >>]]
## 1.
Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! Many are they that rise up against me.
## 2.
Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.
## 3.
But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me, my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.
## 4.
I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.
## 5.
I laid me down and slept; I awaked, for the Lord sustained me.
## 6.
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me round about.
## 7.
Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God; for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheekbone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
## 8.
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord; thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.
