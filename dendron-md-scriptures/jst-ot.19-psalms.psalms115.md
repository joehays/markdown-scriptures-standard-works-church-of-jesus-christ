[[Psalms114|<<-psalms-114]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms116|psalms-116]]ms116|Psalms 116 >>]]
## 1.
Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name be glory for thy mercy and for thy truth\'s sake.
## 2.
Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?
## 3.
But our God is in the heavens; he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.
## 4.
Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men\'s hands.
## 5.
They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;
## 6.
They have ears, but they hear not; noses have they, but they smell not;
## 7.
They have hands, but they handle not; feet have they, but they walk not; neither speak they through their throat.
## 8.
They that make them are like unto them; so is everyone that trusteth in them.
## 9.
O Israel, trust thou in the Lord; he is thy help and thy shield.
## 10.
O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord; he is thy help and thy shield.
## 11.
Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord; he is your help and your shield.
## 12.
The Lord hath been mindful of us; he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.
## 13.
He will bless them that fear the Lord, both small and great.
## 14.
The Lord shall increase you more and more, you and your children.
## 15.
Ye are blessed of the Lord which made heaven and earth.
## 16.
The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord\'s; but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
## 17.
The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.
## 18.
But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and forevermore. Praise the Lord.
