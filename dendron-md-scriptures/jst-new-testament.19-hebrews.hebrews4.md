## 1.
Let us therefore fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.
## 2.
For unto us was the rest preached, as well as unto them; but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.
## 3.
For we who have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, If they harden their hearts they shall not enter into my rest; also, I have sworn, If they will not harden their hearts, they shall enter into my rest; although the works of God were prepared (or finished) from the foundation of the world.
## 4.
For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
## 5.
And in this place again, If they harden not their hearts, they shall enter into my rest.
## 6.
Seeing, therefore, it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief;
## 7.
Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, Today, after so long a time, as it is said, Today, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
## 8.
For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day?
## 9.
There remaineth, therefore, a rest to the people of God.
## 10.
For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.
## 11.
Let us labor, therefore, to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
## 12.
For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of body and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
## 13.
Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight; but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
## 14.
Seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.
## 15.
For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was on all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
## 16.
Let us, therefore, come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
