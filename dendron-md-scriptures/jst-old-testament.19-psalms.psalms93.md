[[Psalms92|<<-psalms-92]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms94|psalms-94]]alms94|Psalms 94 >>]]
## 1.
The Lord reigneth; he is clothed with majesty; the Lord is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself; the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.
## 2.
Thy throne is established of old; thou art from everlasting.
## 3.
The floods have lifted up, O Lord; the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.
## 4.
The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.
## 5.
Thy testimonies are very sure; holiness becometh thine house, O Lord, forever.
