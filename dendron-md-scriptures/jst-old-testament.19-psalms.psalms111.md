## 1.
Praise ye the Lord. I will praise the Lord with my whole heart in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation.
## 2.
The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
## 3.
His work is honorable and glorious; and his righteousness endureth forever.
## 4.
He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered; the Lord is gracious and full of compassion.
## 5.
He hath given meat unto them that fear him; he will ever be mindful of his covenant.
## 6.
He hath showed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.
## 7.
The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.
## 8.
They stand fast forever and ever and are done in truth and uprightness.
## 9.
He sent redemption unto his people; he hath commanded his covenant forever; holy and reverend is his name.
## 10.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do his commandments; his praise endureth forever.
