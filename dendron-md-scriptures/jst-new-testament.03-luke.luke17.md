## 1.
Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offenses will come; but woe to him through whom they come.
## 2.
It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones.
## 3.
Take heed to yourselves. If your brother trespass against you, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
## 4.
And if he trespass against you seven times in a day and seven times in a day turn to you again, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him.
## 5.
And the apostles said unto him, Lord, increase our faith.
## 6.
And the Lord said, If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you might say unto this sycamore tree, Be thou plucked up by the roots, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.
## 7.
But who of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?
## 8.
Will he not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird yourself, and serve me till I have eaten and drunken, and afterward, by and by, you shall eat and drink?
## 9.
Doth he thank that servant because he doeth the things which were commanded him? I say unto you, Nay.
## 10.
So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants. We have done that which was no more than our duty to do.
## 11.
It came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Galilee and Samaria.
## 12.
And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men who were lepers, who stood afar off;
## 13.
And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
## 14.
And he said unto them, Go show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were cleansed.
## 15.
One of them, when he saw he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,
## 16.
And fell down on his face at Jesus\' feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan.
## 17.
And Jesus, answering, said, Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine?
## 18.
There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.
## 19.
And he said unto him, Arise; go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole.
## 20.
And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation;
## 21.
Neither shall they say, Lo, here! or, Lo, there! For, behold, the kingdom of God has already come unto you.
## 22.
And he said unto his disciples, The days will come when they will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and they shall not see it.
## 23.
And if they shall say to you, See here! or, See there! Go not after them, nor follow them.
## 24.
For as the light of the morning, that shineth out of the one part under heaven and lighteneth to the other part under heaven, so shall also the Son of Man be in his day.
## 25.
But first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.
## 26.
And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man.
## 27.
They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage until the day that Noe entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all.
## 28.
Likewise also, as it was in the days of Lot: They did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
## 29.
But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.
## 30.
Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.
## 31.
In that day, the disciple who shall be on the housetop and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away; and he who is in the field, let him likewise not return back.
## 32.
Remember Lot\'s wife.
## 33.
Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.
## 34.
I tell you, In that night there shall be two in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Two shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
## 35.
Two shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
## 36.
And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord, shall they be taken?
## 37.
And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is gathered, or in other words, whithersoever the saints are gathered, thither will the eagles be gathered together, or thither will the remainder be gathered together.
## 38.
This he spake, signifying the gathering of his saints, and of angels descending and gathering the remainder unto them\--the one from the bed, the other from the grinding, and the other from the field, whithersoever he listeth.
## 39.
For verily, there shall be new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
## 40.
And there shall be no unclean thing; for the earth becoming old, even as a garment, having waxed in corruption, wherefore, it vanisheth away; and the footstool remaineth sanctified, cleansed from all sin.
