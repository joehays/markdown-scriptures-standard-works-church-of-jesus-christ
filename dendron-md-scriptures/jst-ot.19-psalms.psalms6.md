[[Psalms5|<<-psalms-5]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms7|psalms-7]]Psalms7|Psalms 7 >>]]
## 1.
O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger; neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
## 2.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak; O Lord, heal me, for my bones are vexed.
## 3.
My soul is also sore vexed. But thou, O Lord, how long?
## 4.
Return, O Lord; deliver my soul; oh, save me for thy mercies\' sake.
## 5.
For in death there is no remembrance of thee. In the grave who shall give thee thanks?
## 6.
I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
## 7.
Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.
## 8.
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.
## 9.
The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receive my prayer.
## 10.
Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed; let them return and be ashamed suddenly.
