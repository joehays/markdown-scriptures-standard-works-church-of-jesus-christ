## 1.
Then Job answered and said,
## 2.
Even today is my complaint bitter; my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
## 3.
Oh, that I knew where I might find him! That I might come even to his seat!
## 4.
I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
## 5.
I would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me.
## 6.
Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.
## 7.
There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered forever from my judge.
## 8.
Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him;
## 9.
On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him; he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him;
## 10.
But he knoweth the way that I take; when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
## 11.
My foot hath held his steps; his way have I kept and not declined.
## 12.
Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
## 13.
But he is in one mind. And who can turn him? And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
## 14.
For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me; and many such things are with him.
## 15.
Therefore am I troubled at his presence; when I consider, I am afraid of him.
## 16.
For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me,
## 17.
Because I was not cut off before the darkness; neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.
