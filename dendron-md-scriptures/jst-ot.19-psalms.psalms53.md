[[Psalms52|<<-psalms-52]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms54|psalms-54]]alms54|Psalms 54 >>]]
## 1.
The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Such are corrupt, and they have done abominable iniquity. There is none that doeth good.
## 2.
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.
## 3.
Every one of them is gone back; they are altogether become filthy.
## 4.
The workers of iniquity have no knowledge; they eat up my people as they eat bread; they have not called upon God.
## 5.
There is none that doeth good, no not one. They were in great fear, for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against him.
## 6.
O Lord, thou hast put to shame those who have said in their hearts there was no fear, because thou hast despised them.
## 7.
Oh, that Zion were come, the salvation of Israel; for out of Zion shall they be judged when God bringeth back the captivity of his people. And Jacob shall rejoice; Israel shall be glad.
