[[Psalms121|<<-psalms-121]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms123|psalms-123]]ms123|Psalms 123 >>]]
## 1.
I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord.
## 2.
Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
## 3.
Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together,
## 4.
Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord.
## 5.
For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
## 6.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; they shall prosper that love thee.
## 7.
Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.
## 8.
For my brethren and companions\' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.
## 9.
Because of the house of the Lord, our God, I will seek thy good.
