## 1.
And on the third day of the week, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there.
## 2.
And Jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage.
## 3.
And when they wanted wine, his mother said unto him, They have no wine.
## 4.
Jesus said unto her, Woman, what wilt thou have me to do for thee? That will I do; for mine hour is not yet come.
## 5.
His mother said unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, see that ye do it.
## 6.
There were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
## 7.
Jesus said unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
## 8.
And he said, Draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare unto him.
## 9.
When the governor of the feast had tasted the water which was made wine (he knew not whence it was, but the servants who drew the water knew), the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
## 10.
And said unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse; but thou hast kept the good wine until now.
## 11.
This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee and manifested forth his glory; and the faith of his disciples was strengthened in him.
## 12.
After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples; and they continued there not many days.
## 13.
And the Jews\' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
## 14.
And found in the temple those who sold oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.
## 15.
And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen, and poured out the changers\' money, and overthrew the tables,
## 16.
And said unto them who sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father\'s house a house of merchandise.
## 17.
And his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.
## 18.
Then spake the Jews and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing thou doest these things?
## 19.
Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
## 20.
Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
## 21.
But he spake of the temple of his body.
## 22.
When, therefore, he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they remembered the scripture and the word which Jesus had said unto them.
## 23.
Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover on the feast day, many believed on his name when they saw the miracles which he did.
## 24.
But Jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all things,
## 25.
And needed not that any should testify of man; for he knew what was in man.
