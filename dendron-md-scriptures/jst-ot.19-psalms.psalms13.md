[[Psalms12|<<-psalms-12]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms14|psalms-14]]alms14|Psalms 14 >>]]
## 1.
How long, O Lord, wilt thou withdraw thyself from me? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me, that I may not see thee? Wilt thou forget me and cast me off from thy presence forever?
## 2.
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, sorrowing in my heart daily? How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
## 3.
Consider me, O Lord, and hear my cry, O my God, and lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the death of the ungodly, lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him.
## 4.
Those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved;
## 5.
But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
## 6.
I will sing unto the Lord because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
