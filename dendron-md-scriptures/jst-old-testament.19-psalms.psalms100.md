[[Psalms99|<<-psalms-99]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms101|psalms-101]]ms101|Psalms 101 >>]]
## 1.
Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.
## 2.
Serve the Lord with gladness; come before his presence with singing.
## 3.
Know ye that the Lord he is God; it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people and the sheep of his pasture.
## 4.
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise; be thankful unto him, and bless his name.
## 5.
For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.
