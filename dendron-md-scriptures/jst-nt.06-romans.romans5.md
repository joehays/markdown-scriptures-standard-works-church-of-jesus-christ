## 1.
Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
## 2.
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
## 3.
And not only this, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
## 4.
And patience, experience; and experience, hope;
## 5.
And hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
## 6.
For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
## 7.
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
## 8.
But God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
## 9.
Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
## 10.
For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
## 11.
And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.
## 12.
Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin, so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.
## 13.
For, before the law, sin was in the world; yet sin is not imputed to those who have no law.
## 14.
Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam\'s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. For I say that through the offense, death reigned over all.
## 15.
But the offense is not as the free gift, for the gift aboundeth. For, if through the offense of one, many be dead, much more the grace of God and the gift by grace hath abounded by one man, Jesus Christ, unto many.
## 16.
And not as by one that sinned is the gift; for the judgment is by one to condemnation; but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification.
## 17.
For if by one man\'s offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.
## 18.
Therefore, as by the offense of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even so, by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.
## 19.
For as by one man\'s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
## 20.
Moreover, the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound,
## 21.
That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
