[[Psalms141|<<-psalms-141]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms143|psalms-143]]ms143|Psalms 143 >>]]
## 1.
I cried unto the Lord with my voice; with my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication.
## 2.
I poured out my complaint before him; I showed before him my trouble.
## 3.
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
## 4.
I looked on my right hand and beheld, but there was no man that would know me; refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.
## 5.
I cried unto thee, O Lord; I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.
## 6.
Attend unto my cry, for I am brought very low; deliver me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I.
## 7.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name; the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
