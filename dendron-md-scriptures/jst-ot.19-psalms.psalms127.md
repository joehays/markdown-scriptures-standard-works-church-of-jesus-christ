[[Psalms126|<<-psalms-126]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms128|psalms-128]]ms128|Psalms 128 >>]]
## 1.
Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
## 2.
It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows; for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
## 3.
Lo, children are a heritage of the Lord; and the fruit of the womb is his reward.
## 4.
As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man, so are children of the youth.
## 5.
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them; they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
