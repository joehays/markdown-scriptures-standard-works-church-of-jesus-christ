[[Psalms98|<<-psalms-98]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms100|psalms-100]]ms100|Psalms 100 >>]]
## 1.
The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble; he sitteth between the cherubim; let the earth be moved.
## 2.
The Lord is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.
## 3.
Let them praise thy great and terrible name, for it is holy.
## 4.
The king\'s strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity; thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
## 5.
Exalt ye the Lord, our God, and worship at his footstool, for he is holy.
## 6.
Moses and Aaron among his priests and Samuel among them that call upon his name\--they called upon the Lord, and he answered them.
## 7.
He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar; they kept his testimonies and the ordinance that he gave them.
## 8.
Thou answeredst them, O Lord, our God; thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.
## 9.
Exalt the Lord, our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the Lord, our God, is holy.
