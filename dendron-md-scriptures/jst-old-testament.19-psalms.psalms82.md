[[Psalms81|<<-psalms-81]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms83|psalms-83]]alms83|Psalms 83 >>]]
## 1.
God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
## 2.
How long will ye suffer them to judge unjustly and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
## 3.
Defend the poor and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and needy.
## 4.
Deliver the poor and needy; rid them out of the hand of the wicked.
## 5.
They know not; neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
## 6.
I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the Most High.
## 7.
But ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes.
## 8.
Arise, O God; judge the earth; for thou shalt inherit all nations.
