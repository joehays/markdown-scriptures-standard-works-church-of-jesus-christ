[[Psalms16|<<-psalms-16]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms18|psalms-18]]alms18|Psalms 18 >>]]
## 1.
Give me right words, O Lord; speak, and thy servant shall hear thee; attend unto my cry, and give ear unto my prayer. I come not unto thee out of feigned lips.
## 2.
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.
## 3.
Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me; thou shalt find nothing evil in me, for I am purposed my mouth shall not transgress concerning the works of men.
## 4.
By the word of thy lips I have kept out of the paths of the destroyer.
## 5.
Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.
## 6.
I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear, O God, my speech and incline thine ear unto me.
## 7.
Show thy marvelous loving-kindness, O thou that savest them which put their trust in thee, by thy right hand from those that rise up.
## 8.
Keep me as the apple of the eye. Hide me under the shadow of thy wings from the wicked that oppress me.
## 9.
My deadly enemies compass me about;
## 10.
They are enclosed in their own fat; with their mouth they speak proudly.
## 11.
They have now compassed us in our steps; they have set their eyes, bowing down to the earth,
## 12.
Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey and, as it were, a young lion lurking in secret places.
## 13.
Arise, O Lord; disappoint him; cast him down.
## 14.
Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword, from men by thy strong hand\--yea, O Lord, from men of the world; for their portion is in their life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy good things; they are full of children, and they die and leave the rest of their inheritance to their babes.
## 15.
As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
