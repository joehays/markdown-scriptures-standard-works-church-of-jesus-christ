[[Psalms40|<<-psalms-40]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms42|psalms-42]]alms42|Psalms 42 >>]]
## 1.
Blessed is he that considereth the poor; the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble.
## 2.
The Lord will preserve him and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth; and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.
## 3.
The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing; thou wilt make all his pains to cease when he is laid in his bed of sickness.
## 4.
I said, Lord, be merciful unto me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.
## 5.
Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die and his name perish?
## 6.
And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity; his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.
## 7.
All that hate me whisper together against me; against me do they devise my hurt.
## 8.
An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him; and now that he lieth, he shall rise up no more.
## 9.
Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.
## 10.
But thou, O Lord, be merciful unto me and raise me up, that I may requite them.
## 11.
By this I know that thou favorest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
## 12.
And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity and settest me before thy face forever.
## 13.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and to everlasting. Amen and amen.
