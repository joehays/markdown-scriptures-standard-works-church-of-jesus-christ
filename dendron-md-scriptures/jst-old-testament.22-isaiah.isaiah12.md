## 1.
And in that day thou shalt say, O Lord, I will praise thee; though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.
## 2.
Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid; for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.
## 3.
Therefore, with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.
## 4.
And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.
## 5.
Sing unto the Lord, for he hath done excellent things; this is known in all the earth.
## 6.
Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
