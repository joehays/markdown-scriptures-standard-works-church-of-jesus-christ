[[Psalms148|<<-psalms-148]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms150|psalms-150]]ms150|Psalms 150 >>]]
## 1.
Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints.
## 2.
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him; let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
## 3.
Let them praise his name in the dance; let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.
## 4.
For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people; he will beautify the meek with salvation.
## 5.
Let the saints be joyful in glory; let them sing aloud upon their beds.
## 6.
Let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand,
## 7.
To execute vengeance upon the heathen and punishments upon the people,
## 8.
To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron,
## 9.
To execute upon them the judgment written; this honor have all his saints. Praise ye the Lord.
