[[Psalms35|<<-psalms-35]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms37|psalms-37]]alms37|Psalms 37 >>]]
## 1.
The wicked, who live in transgression, saith in their hearts, There is no condemnation; for there is no fear of God before their eyes.
## 2.
For they flatter themselves in their own eyes until their iniquities are found to be hateful.
## 3.
The words of their mouth are full of iniquity and deceit. The wicked man hath left off to be wise and to do good;
## 4.
He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good.
## 5.
O Lord, thou art in the heavens; they are full of thy mercy. And the thoughts of a righteous man ascendeth up unto thee whose throne is far above the clouds.
## 6.
He is filled with thy righteousness like the great mountains, and with thy judgments like a great deep. O Lord, thou preservest man and beast.
## 7.
How excellent is thy loving-kindness, O God! Therefore, the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
## 8.
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
## 9.
For with thee is the fountain of life; in thy light shall we see light.
## 10.
Oh, continue thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee, and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
## 11.
Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.
## 12.
They are the workers of iniquity and shall fall; they shall be cast down and shall not be able to rise.
