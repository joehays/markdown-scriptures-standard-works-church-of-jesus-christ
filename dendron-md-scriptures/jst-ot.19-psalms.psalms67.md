God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause his face to shine upon us, Selah,

That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.
## 3.
Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
## 4.
Oh, let the nations be glad and sing for joy; for thou shalt judge the people righteously and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.
## 5.
Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.

Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.
## 7.
God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
