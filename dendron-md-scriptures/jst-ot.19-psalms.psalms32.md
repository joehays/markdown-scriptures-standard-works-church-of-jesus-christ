[[Psalms31|<<-psalms-31]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms33|psalms-33]]alms33|Psalms 33 >>]]
## 1.
Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven and who have no sins to be covered.
## 2.
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guile.
## 3.
When I kept silence, my spirit failed within me; when I opened my mouth, my bones waxed old through my speaking all the day long.
## 4.
For day and night thy Spirit was heavy upon me; my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.
## 5.
I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
## 6.
For this shall everyone that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found; surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.
## 7.
Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.
## 8.
Thou hast said, I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will guide thee with mine eye.
## 9.
Be ye not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding, whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.
## 10.
Many sorrows shall be to the wicked; but he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about.
## 11.
Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, ye righteous; and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
