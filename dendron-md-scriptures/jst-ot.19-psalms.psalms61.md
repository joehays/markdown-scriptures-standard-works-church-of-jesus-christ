[[Psalms60|<<-psalms-60]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms62|psalms-62]]alms62|Psalms 62 >>]]
## 1.
Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
## 2.
From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed; lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
## 3.
For thou hast been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy.
## 4.
I will abide in thy tabernacle forever; I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.
## 5.
For thou, O God, hast heard my vows; thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.
## 6.
Thou wilt prolong the king\'s life and his years as many generations.
## 7.
He shall abide before God forever; oh, prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.
## 8.
So will I sing praise unto thy name forever, that I may daily perform my vows.
