[[Psalms22|<<-psalms-22]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms24|psalms-24]]alms24|Psalms 24 >>]]
## 1.
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
## 2.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside the still waters.
## 3.
He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name\'s sake.
## 4.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
## 5.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
## 6.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
