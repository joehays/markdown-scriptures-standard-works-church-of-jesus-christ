## 1.
And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house and the Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies,
## 2.
That the king said unto Nathan, the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.
## 3.
And Nathan said to the king, Go; do all that is in thine heart, for the Lord is with thee.
## 4.
And it came to pass that night that the word of the Lord came unto Nathan, saying,
## 5.
Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the Lord, Shalt thou build me a house for me to dwell in?
## 6.
Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
## 7.
In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me a house of cedar?
## 8.
Now, therefore, so shalt thou say unto my servant David: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel;
## 9.
And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.
## 10.
Moreover, I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more as beforetime,
## 11.
And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the Lord telleth thee that he will make thee a house.
## 12.
And when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels; and I will establish his kingdom.
## 13.
He shall build a house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom forever.
## 14.
I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men.
## 15.
But my mercy shall not depart away from him as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.
## 16.
And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee; thy throne shall be established forever.
## 17.
According to all these words and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
## 18.
Then went King David in and sat before the Lord. And he said, Who am I, O Lord God? And what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
## 19.
And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord God; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant\'s house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord God?
## 20.
And what can David say more unto thee? For thou, Lord God, knowest thy servant.
## 21.
For thy word\'s sake and according to thine own heart hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.
## 22.
Wherefore, thou art great, O Lord God; for there is none like thee; neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
## 23.
And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel\--whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land before thy people\--which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?
## 24.
For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee forever; and thou, Lord, art become their God.
## 25.
And now, O Lord God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house, establish it forever, and do as thou hast said.
## 26.
And let thy name be magnified forever, saying, The Lord of hosts is the God over Israel; and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.
## 27.
For thou, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house; therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.
## 28.
And now, O Lord God, thou art that God; and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant;
## 29.
Therefore, now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue forever before thee; for thou, O Lord God, hast spoken it; and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed forever.
