[[Psalms120|<<-psalms-120]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms122|psalms-122]]ms122|Psalms 122 >>]]
## 1.
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help.
## 2.
My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.
## 3.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
## 4.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; he that keepeth thee will not slumber.
## 5.
The Lord is thy keeper; the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.
## 6.
The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
## 7.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil; he shall preserve thy soul.
## 8.
The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even forevermore.
