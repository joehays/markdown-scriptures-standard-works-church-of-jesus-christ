[[Psalms137|<<-psalms-137]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms139|psalms-139]]ms139|Psalms 139 >>]]
## 1.
I will praise thee with my whole heart; before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.
## 2.
I will worship toward thy holy temple and praise thy name for thy loving-kindness and for thy truth; for that hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
## 3.
In the day when I cried, thou answeredst me and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.
## 4.
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord, when they hear the words of thy mouth.
## 5.
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord, for great is the glory of the Lord.
## 6.
Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly; but the proud he knoweth afar off.
## 7.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me; thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.
## 8.
The Lord will perfect me in knowledge concerning his kingdom. I will praise thee, O Lord, forever; for thou art merciful and wilt not forsake the works of thine own hands.
