[[Psalms132|<<-psalms-132]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms134|psalms-134]]ms134|Psalms 134 >>]]
## 1.
Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
## 2.
It is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron\'s beard, that went down to the skirts of his garments,
## 3.
As the dew of Hermon and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion; for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life forevermore.
