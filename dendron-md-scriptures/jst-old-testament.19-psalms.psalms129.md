[[Psalms128|<<-psalms-128]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms130|psalms-130]]ms130|Psalms 130 >>]]
## 1.
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say;
## 2.
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth; yet they have not prevailed against me.
## 3.
The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows.
## 4.
The Lord is righteous; he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
## 5.
Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
## 6.
Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up,
## 7.
Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
## 8.
Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you; we bless you in the name of the Lord.
