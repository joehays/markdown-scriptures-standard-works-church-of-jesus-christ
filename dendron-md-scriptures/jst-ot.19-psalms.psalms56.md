[[Psalms55|<<-psalms-55]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms57|psalms-57]]alms57|Psalms 57 >>]]
## 1.
Be merciful unto me, O God; for man would swallow me up; he, fighting daily, oppresseth me.
## 2.
Mine enemies would daily swallow me up; for they be many that fight against me, O thou Most High.
## 3.
What! Am I afraid? I will trust in thee.
## 4.
In God I will praise his word; in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
## 5.
Every day they wrest my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
## 6.
They gather themselves together; they hide themselves; they mark my steps when they wait for my soul.
## 7.
Shall they escape by iniquity? In thine anger cast down the people, O God.
## 8.
Thou tellest my wanderings; put thou my tears into thy bottle. Are they not in thy book?
## 9.
When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back; this I know, for God is for me.
## 10.
In God will I praise his word; in the Lord will I praise his word.
## 11.
In God have I put my trust; I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
## 12.
Thy vows are upon me, O God; I will render praises unto thee.
## 13.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death. Wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
