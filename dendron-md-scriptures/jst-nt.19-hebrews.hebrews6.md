## 1.
Therefore, not leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
## 2.
Of the doctrine of baptisms, of laying on of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
## 3.
And we will go on unto perfection if God permit.
## 4.
For he hath made it impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
## 5.
And have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come,
## 6.
If they shall fall away, to be renewed again unto repentance, seeing they crucify unto themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame.
## 7.
For the day cometh that the earth\--which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them who dwelleth thereon, by whom it is dressed, who now receiveth blessings from God\--shall be cleansed with fire.
## 8.
For that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh unto cursing; therefore, they who bring not forth good fruits shall be cast into the fire; for their end is to be burned.
## 9.
But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things of you and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.
## 10.
For God is not unrighteous; therefore, he will not forget your work and labor of love, which ye have showed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister.
## 11.
And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end,
## 12.
That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who, through faith and patience, inherit the promises.
## 13.
For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,
## 14.
Saying, Surely blessing, I will bless thee and multiplying, I will multiply thee.
## 15.
And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
## 16.
For men verily swear by the greater; and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.
## 17.
Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath\--
## 18.
That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us,
## 19.
Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil,
## 20.
Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
