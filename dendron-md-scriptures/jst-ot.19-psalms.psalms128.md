[[Psalms127|<<-psalms-127]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms129|psalms-129]]ms129|Psalms 129 >>]]
## 1.
Blessed is everyone that feareth the Lord, that walketh in his ways.
## 2.
For thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands; happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
## 3.
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house\--thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
## 4.
Behold that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord.
## 5.
The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion; and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
## 6.
Yea, thou shalt see thy children\'s children and peace upon Israel.
