[[Psalms108|<<-psalms-108]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms110|psalms-110]]ms110|Psalms 110 >>]]
## 1.
Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
## 2.
For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me; they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
## 3.
They compassed me about; they spake against me also with words of hatred and fought against me without a cause.
## 4.
And, notwithstanding my love, they are my adversaries; yet I will continue in prayer for them.
## 5.
And they have rewarded me evil for good and hatred for my love.
## 6.
Set thou a wicked man over them; and let Satan stand at his right hand.
## 7.
When they shall be judged, let them be condemned, and let their prayer become sin.
## 8.
Let their days be few; let another take their office.
## 9.
Let their children be fatherless and their wives widows.
## 10.
Let their children be continually vagabonds and beg; let them seek also out of their desolate places.
## 11.
Let the extortioner catch all that they have; and let the stranger spoil their labor.
## 12.
Let there be none to extend mercy unto them; neither let there be any to favor their fatherless children.
## 13.
Let their posterity be cut off in the generation following; let their names be blotted out.
## 14.
Let the iniquity of their fathers be remembered before the Lord; and let not the sin of their mothers be blotted out.
## 15.
Let them be before the Lord continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth,
## 16.
Because they remembered not to show mercy but persecuted the poor and needy man, that they might even slay the broken in heart.
## 17.
As they loved cursing, so let it come upon them; as they delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from them.
## 18.
As they clothed themselves with cursing like as with their garments, so let it come into their bowels like water and like oil into their bones.
## 19.
Let it be unto them as a garment which covereth them and for a girdle wherewith they are girded continually.
## 20.
This shall be the reward of mine adversaries from the Lord, and of them who speak evil against my soul.
## 21.
But do thou deliver me, O Lord, my God, for thy name\'s sake; because thy mercy is good, therefore deliver thou me.
## 22.
For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
## 23.
I am gone like the shadow when it declineth; I am tossed up and down as the locust.
## 24.
My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.
## 25.
I became also a reproach unto them; when they looked upon me, they shook their heads.
## 26.
Help me, O Lord, my God; oh, save me according to thy mercy,
## 27.
That they may know that this is thy hand, that thou, Lord, hast done it.
## 28.
Let them curse but bless thou; when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
## 29.
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion as with a mantle.
## 30.
I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
## 31.
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.
