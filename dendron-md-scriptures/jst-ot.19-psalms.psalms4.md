[[Psalms3|<<-psalms-3]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms5|psalms-5]]Psalms5|Psalms 5 >>]]
## 1.
Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness; thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
## 2.
O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? How long will ye love vanity and seek after leasing? Selah.
## 3.
But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself; the Lord will hear when I call unto him.
## 4.
Stand in awe, and sin not; commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.
## 5.
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord.
## 6.
There be many that say, Who will show us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
## 7.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.
## 8.
I will both lay me down in peace and sleep; for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety.
