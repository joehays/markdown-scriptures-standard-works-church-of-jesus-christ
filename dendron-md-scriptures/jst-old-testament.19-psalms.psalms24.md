[[Psalms23|<<-psalms-23]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms25|psalms-25]]alms25|Psalms 25 >>]]
## 1.
The earth is the Lord\'s, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
## 2.
For he hath founded it upon the seas and established it upon the floods.
## 3.
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand in his holy place?
## 4.
He that hath clean hands and a pure heart, who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully.
## 5.
He shall receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
## 6.
This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.
## 7.
Lift up your heads, O ye generations of Jacob; and be ye lifted up; and the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle, who is the king of glory, shall establish you forever.
## 8.
And he will roll away the heavens and will come down to redeem his people, to make you an everlasting name, to establish you upon his everlasting rock.
## 9.
Lift up your heads, O ye generations of Jacob; lift up your heads, ye everlasting generations; and the Lord of hosts, the king of kings,
## 10.
Even the king of glory, shall come unto you, and shall redeem his people, and shall establish them in righteousness. Selah.
