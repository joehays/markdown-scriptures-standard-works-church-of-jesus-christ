[[Psalms138|<<-psalms-138]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms140|psalms-140]]ms140|Psalms 140 >>]]
## 1.
O Lord, thou hast searched me and known me.
## 2.
Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising; thou understandest my thought afar off.
## 3.
Thou compassest my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways.
## 4.
For there is not a word in my tongue, but lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether.
## 5.
Thou hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me.
## 6.
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high; I cannot attain unto it.
## 7.
Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
## 8.
If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there; if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
## 9.
If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
## 10.
Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
## 11.
If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me,
## 12.
Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day; the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
## 13.
For thou hast possessed my reins; thou hast covered me in my mother\'s womb.
## 14.
I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvelous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.
## 15.
My substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
## 16.
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet I knew none of them.
## 17.
How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them!
## 18.
If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand; when I awake, I am still with thee.
## 19.
Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God; depart from me, therefore, ye bloody men.
## 20.
For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.
## 21.
Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
## 22.
I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them mine enemies.
## 23.
Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts;
## 24.
And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
