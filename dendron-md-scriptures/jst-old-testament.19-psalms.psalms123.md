[[Psalms122|<<-psalms-122]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms124|psalms-124]]ms124|Psalms 124 >>]]
## 1.
Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
## 2.
Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, so our eyes wait upon the Lord, our God, until that he have mercy upon us.
## 3.
Have mercy upon us, O Lord; have mercy upon us; for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
## 4.
Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease and with the contempt of the proud.
