[[Psalms11|<<-psalms-11]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms13|psalms-13]]alms13|Psalms 13 >>]]
## 1.
In that day thou shalt help, O Lord, the poor and the meek of the earth. For the godly man shall cease to be found, and the faithful fail from among the children of men.
## 2.
They shall speak vanity, everyone with his neighbor; with flattering lips, with a double heart do they speak.
## 3.
But the Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaketh proud things,
## 4.
Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own. Who shall be Lord over us?
## 5.
Therefore, thus saith the Lord, I will arise in that day; I will stand upon the earth, and I will judge the earth for the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy; and their cry hath entered into mine ear.
## 6.
Therefore, the Lord shall sit in judgment upon all those who say in their hearts, We all sit in safety, and puffeth at him. These are the words of the Lord, yea, pure words, like silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
## 7.
Thou shalt save thy people, O Lord; thou shalt keep them; thou shalt preserve them from the wickedness of their generations forever.
## 8.
The wicked walk on every side, and the vilest men are exalted; but in the day of their pride thou shalt visit them.
