[[Psalms85|<<-psalms-85]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms87|psalms-87]]alms87|Psalms 87 >>]]
## 1.
Bow down thine ear, O Lord; hear me, for I am poor and needy.
## 2.
Preserve my soul, for I am holy; O thou, my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
## 3.
Be merciful unto me, O Lord; for I cry unto thee daily.
## 4.
Rejoice the soul of thy servant; for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
## 5.
For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
## 6.
Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer, and attend to the voice of my supplications.
## 7.
In the day of my trouble, I will call upon thee; for thou wilt answer me.
## 8.
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.
## 9.
All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord, and shall glorify thy name.
## 10.
For thou art great and doest wondrous things; thou art God alone.
## 11.
Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy truth; unite my heart to fear thy name.
## 12.
I will praise thee, O Lord, my God, with all my heart; and I will glorify thy name forevermore.
## 13.
For great is thy mercy toward me; and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
## 14.
O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul and have not set thee before them.
## 15.
But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
## 16.
Oh, turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.
## 17.
Show me a token for good, that they which hate me may see it and be ashamed because thou, Lord, hast helped me and comforted me.
