[[Psalms1|<<-psalms-1]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms3|psalms-3]]Psalms3|Psalms 3 >>]]
## 1.
Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing?
## 2.
The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against his Anointed, saying,
## 3.
Let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us.
## 4.
He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision.
## 5.
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure.
## 6.
Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion.
## 7.
I will declare the decree; the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
## 8.
Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
## 9.
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter\'s vessel.
## 10.
Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
## 11.
Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
## 12.
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
