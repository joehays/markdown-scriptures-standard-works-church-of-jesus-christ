## 1.
Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? Are not his days also like the days of a hireling?
## 2.
As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow and as a hireling looketh for the reward of his work,
## 3.
So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
## 4.
When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise and the night be gone? And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
## 5.
My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken and become loathsome.
## 6.
My days are swifter than a weaver\'s shuttle and are spent without hope.
## 7.
Oh, remember that my life is wind; mine eye shall no more see good.
## 8.
The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more; thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.
## 9.
As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.
## 10.
He shall return no more to his house; neither shall his place know him any more.
## 11.
Therefore, I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
## 12.
Am I a sea or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?
## 13.
When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint,
## 14.
Then thou scarest me with dreams and terrifiest me through visions,
## 15.
So that my soul chooseth strangling and death rather than my life.
## 16.
I loathe it; I would not live always; let me alone, for my days are vanity.
## 17.
What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? And that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?
## 18.
And that thou shouldest visit him every morning and try him every moment?
## 19.
How long wilt thou not depart from me nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
## 20.
I have sinned. What shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? Why hast thou set me as a mark against thee so that I am a burden to myself?
## 21.
And why dost thou not pardon my transgression and take away mine iniquity? For now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.
