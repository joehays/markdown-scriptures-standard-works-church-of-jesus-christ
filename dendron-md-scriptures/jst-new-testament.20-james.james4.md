## 1.
From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?
## 2.
Ye lust and have not; ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain; ye fight and war; yet ye have not because ye ask not.
## 3.
Ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.
## 4.
Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever, therefore, will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
## 5.
Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?
## 6.
But he giveth more grace. Wherefore, he saith, God resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble.
## 7.
Submit yourselves, therefore, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
## 8.
Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.
## 9.
Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness.
## 10.
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
## 11.
Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law; but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law but a judge.
## 12.
There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. Who art thou that judgest another?
## 13.
Go to now, ye that say, Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain;
## 14.
Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away.
## 15.
For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live and do this or that.
## 16.
But now ye rejoice in your boastings; all such rejoicing is evil.
## 17.
Therefore, to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not, to him it is sin.
