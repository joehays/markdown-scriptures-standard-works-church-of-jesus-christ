[[Psalms57|<<-psalms-57]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms59|psalms-59]]alms59|Psalms 59 >>]]
## 1.
Do ye, indeed, speak righteousness, O congregation? Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
## 2.
Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.
## 3.
The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.
## 4.
Their poison is like the poison of a serpent; they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear,
## 5.
Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.
## 6.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth; break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Lord.
## 7.
Let them melt away as waters which run continually; when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
## 8.
As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away, like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.
## 9.
Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living and in his wrath.
## 10.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked,
## 11.
So that a man shall say, Verily, there is a reward for the righteous; verily, he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
