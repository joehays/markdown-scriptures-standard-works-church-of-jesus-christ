[[Psalms145|<<-psalms-145]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms147|psalms-147]]ms147|Psalms 147 >>]]
## 1.
Praise ye the Lord. Praise the Lord, O my soul.
## 2.
While I live will I praise the Lord; I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
## 3.
Put not your trust in princes nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
## 4.
His breath goeth forth; he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
## 5.
Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord, his God,
## 6.
Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is, which keepeth truth forever,
## 7.
Which executeth judgment for the oppressed, which giveth food to the hungry. The Lord looseth the prisoners;
## 8.
The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind; the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down; the Lord loveth the righteous;
## 9.
The Lord preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow; but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.
## 10.
The Lord shall reign forever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.
