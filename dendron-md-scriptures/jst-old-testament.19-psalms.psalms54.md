[[Psalms53|<<-psalms-53]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms55|psalms-55]]alms55|Psalms 55 >>]]
## 1.
Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
## 2.
Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
## 3.
For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul; they have not set God before them. Selah.
## 4.
Behold, God is mine helper; the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
## 5.
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies\--cut them off in thy truth.
## 6.
I will freely sacrifice unto thee; I will praise thy name, O Lord, for it is good.
## 7.
For he hath delivered me out of all trouble; and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
