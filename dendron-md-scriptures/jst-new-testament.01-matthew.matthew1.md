[[JST/JST Old Testament/38 Malachi/Malachi4|<<-malachi-4]] | [[jst-new-testament.01[[JST/JST New Testament/01 Matthew/Matthew2|matthew-2]]tthew2|Matthew 2 >>]]
## 1.
The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the son of Abraham.
## 2.
Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; and Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; and Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naason; and Naason begat Salmon; and Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; and Jesse begat David the king.
## 3.
And David the king begat Solomon of her whom David had taken of Urias; and Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; and Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; and Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias; and Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias; and Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon.
## 4.
And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobable; and Zorobable begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, as the prophets have written, who is called Christ.
## 5.
So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon were fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon until Christ were fourteen generations.
