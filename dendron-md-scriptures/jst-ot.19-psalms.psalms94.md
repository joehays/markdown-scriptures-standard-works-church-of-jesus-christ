[[Psalms93|<<-psalms-93]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms95|psalms-95]]alms95|Psalms 95 >>]]
## 1.
O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth, O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, show thyself.
## 2.
Lift up thyself, thou Judge of the earth; render a reward to the proud.
## 3.
Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?
## 4.
How long shall they utter and speak hard things, and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?
## 5.
They break in pieces thy people, O Lord, and afflict thine heritage.
## 6.
They slay the widow and the stranger and murder the fatherless.
## 7.
Yet they say, The Lord shall not see; neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.
## 8.
Understand, ye brutish among the people and ye fools. When will ye be wise?
## 9.
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?
## 10.
He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? He that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?
## 11.
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.
## 12.
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of thy law,
## 13.
That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity until the pit be digged for the wicked.
## 14.
For the Lord will not cast off his people; neither will he forsake his inheritance.
## 15.
But judgment shall return unto righteousness; and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
## 16.
Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? Or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
## 17.
Unless the Lord had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.
## 18.
When I said, My foot slippeth, thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.
## 19.
In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.
## 20.
Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?
## 21.
They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous and condemn the innocent blood.
## 22.
But the Lord is my defense; and my God is the rock of my refuge.
## 23.
And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the Lord, our God, shall cut them off.
