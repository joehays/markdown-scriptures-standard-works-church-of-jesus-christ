[[Psalms15|<<-psalms-15]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms17|psalms-17]]alms17|Psalms 17 >>]]
## 1.
Preserve me, O God, for in thee do I put my trust.
## 2.
Thou hast said unto me that thou art the Lord, my God, and, My goodness is extended unto thee,
## 3.
And to all the saints that dwell in the earth, and the excellent, in whom is all my delight.
## 4.
And the wicked, there is no delight in them; their sorrows shall be multiplied upon all those who hasten for to seek another god; their drink offerings of blood will I not accept nor take up their names into my lips.
## 5.
Therefore, thou, Lord, art the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup; thou maintainest my lot.
## 6.
The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.
## 7.
I will bless the Lord who hath given me counsel; my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.
## 8.
I have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
## 9.
Therefore, my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also shall rest in hope.
## 10.
For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
## 11.
Thou wilt show me the path of life; in thy presence is fullness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore.
