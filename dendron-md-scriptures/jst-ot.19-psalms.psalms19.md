[[Psalms18|<<-psalms-18]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms20|psalms-20]]alms20|Psalms 20 >>]]
## 1.
The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth his handiwork.
## 2.
Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge.
## 3.
No speech nor language can be if their voice is not heard.
## 4.
Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
## 5.
Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.
## 6.
His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it; and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
## 7.
The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
## 8.
The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.
## 9.
The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.
## 10.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold\--sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
## 11.
Moreover, by them is thy servant warned; and in keeping of them there is great reward.
## 12.
Who can understand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults.
## 13.
Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous acts; let them not have dominion over me; then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.
## 14.
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my redeemer.
