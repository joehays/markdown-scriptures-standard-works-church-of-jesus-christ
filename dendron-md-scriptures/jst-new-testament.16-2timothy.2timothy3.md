## 1.
This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
## 2.
For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
## 3.
Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
## 4.
Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God,
## 5.
Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof. From such turn away.
## 6.
For of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,
## 7.
Ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
## 8.
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth\--men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.
## 9.
But they shall proceed no further; for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.
## 10.
But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,
## 11.
Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra. What persecutions I endured! But out of them all the Lord delivered me.
## 12.
Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
## 13.
For evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
## 14.
But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them,
## 15.
And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
## 16.
And all scripture given by inspiration of God is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,
## 17.
That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.
