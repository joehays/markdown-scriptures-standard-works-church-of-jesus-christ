## 1.
Boast not thyself of tomorrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.
## 2.
Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.
## 3.
A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool\'s wrath is heavier than them both.
## 4.
Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous. But who is able to stand before envy?
## 5.
Open rebuke is better than secret love.
## 6.
Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.
## 7.
The full soul loatheth a honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
## 8.
As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place.
## 9.
Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart; so doth the sweetness of a man\'s friend by hearty counsel.
## 10.
Thine own friend and thy father\'s friend forsake not; neither go into thy brother\'s house in the day of thy calamity; for better is a neighbor that is near than a brother far off.
## 11.
My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.
## 12.
A prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself; but the simple pass on and are punished.
## 13.
Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
## 14.
He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
## 15.
A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.
## 16.
Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.
## 17.
Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
## 18.
Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof; so he that waiteth on his master shall be honored.
## 19.
As in water, face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.
## 20.
Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
## 21.
As the fining pot for silver and the furnace for gold, so is a man to his praise.
## 22.
Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
## 23.
Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds;
## 24.
For riches are not forever. And doth the crown endure to every generation?
## 25.
The hay appeareth, and the tender grass showeth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.
## 26.
The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.
## 27.
And thou shalt have goats\' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.
