## 1.
Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan, the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the Lord remaineth under curtains.
## 2.
Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart, for God is with thee.
## 3.
And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
## 4.
Go and tell David, my servant, Thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in;
## 5.
For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to another.
## 6.
Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedars?
## 7.
Now, therefore, thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel.
## 8.
And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.
## 9.
Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,
## 10.
And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover, I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore, I tell thee that the Lord will build thee a house.
## 11.
And it shall come to pass when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
## 12.
He shall build me a house, and I will stablish his throne forever.
## 13.
I will be his father, and he shall be my son; and I will not take my mercy away from him as I took it from him that was before thee;
## 14.
But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom forever; and his throne shall be established forevermore.
## 15.
According to all these words and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
## 16.
And David, the king, came, and sat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
## 17.
And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant\'s house for a great while to come and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Lord God.
## 18.
What can David speak more to thee for the honor of thy servant? For thou knowest thy servant.
## 19.
O Lord, for thy servant\'s sake and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.
## 20.
O Lord, there is none like thee; neither is there any God besides thee according to all that we have heard with our ears.
## 21.
And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?
## 22.
For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people forever; and thou, Lord, becamest their God.
## 23.
Therefore, now, Lord, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established forever, and do as thou hast said.
## 24.
Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified forever, saying, The Lord of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel; and let the house of David, thy servant, be established before thee.
## 25.
For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him a house; therefore, thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.
## 26.
And now, Lord, thou art God and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant;
## 27.
Now, therefore, let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee forever; for thou blessest, O Lord, and it shall be blessed forever.
