[[Psalms147|<<-psalms-147]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms149|psalms-149]]ms149|Psalms 149 >>]]
## 1.
Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord from the heavens; praise him in the heights.
## 2.
Praise ye him, all his angels; praise ye him, all his hosts.
## 3.
Praise ye him, sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars of light.
## 4.
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens and ye waters that be above the heavens.
## 5.
Let them praise the name of the Lord; for he commanded, and they were created.
## 6.
He hath also stablished them forever and ever; he hath made a decree which shall not pass.
## 7.
Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons and all deeps.
## 8.
Fire and hail, snow and vapor, stormy wind fulfilling his word,
## 9.
Mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars,
## 10.
Beasts and all cattle, creeping things and flying fowl,
## 11.
Kings of the earth and all people, princes and all judges of the earth,
## 12.
Both young men and maidens, old men and children\--
## 13.
Let them praise the name of the Lord; for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.
## 14.
He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints, even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the Lord.
