## 1.
And Jesus entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.
## 2.
And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed; and Jesus, knowing their faith, said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee; go thy way and sin no more.
## 3.
And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.
## 4.
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Wherefore is it that ye think evil in your hearts?
## 5.
For is it not easier to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee, than to say, Arise and walk?
## 6.
But I said this that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins.
## 7.
Then Jesus said unto the sick of the palsy, Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy house.
## 8.
And he immediately arose and departed to his house.
## 9.
But when the multitude saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such power unto men.
## 10.
And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man named Matthew, sitting at the place where they received tribute, as was customary in those days; and he said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
## 11.
And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and with his disciples.
## 12.
And when the Pharisees saw them, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your master with publicans and sinners?
## 13.
But when Jesus heard them, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.
## 14.
But go ye and learn what this meaneth: I will have mercy and not sacrifice; for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
## 15.
And while he was thus teaching, there came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?
## 16.
And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bride-chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them?
## 17.
But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them; and then shall they fast.
## 18.
Then said the Pharisees unto him, Why will ye not receive us with our baptism, seeing we keep the whole law?
## 19.
But Jesus said unto them, Ye keep not the law. If ye had kept the law, ye would have received me; for I am he who gave the law.
## 20.
I receive not you with your baptism because it profiteth you nothing.
## 21.
For when that which is new is come, the old is ready to be put away.
## 22.
For no man putteth a piece of new cloth on an old garment; for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.
## 23.
Neither do men put new wine into old bottles, else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish; but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.
## 24.
While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler and worshiped him, saying, My daughter is even now dying; but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
## 25.
And Jesus arose and followed him, and also his disciples; and much people thronged him.
## 26.
And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him and touched the hem of his garment.
## 27.
For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.
## 28.
But Jesus turned him about; and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.
## 29.
And when Jesus came into the ruler\'s house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,
## 30.
He said unto them, Give place; for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.
## 31.
But when the people were put forth, he went in and took her by the hand; and the maid arose.
## 32.
And the fame of Jesus went abroad into all that land.
## 33.
And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying and saying, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on us.
## 34.
And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.
## 35.
Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith, be it unto you.
## 36.
And their eyes were opened; and straitly he charged them, saying, Keep my commandments, and see ye tell no man in this place, that no man know it.
## 37.
But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.
## 38.
And as they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.
## 39.
And when the devil was cast out, the dumb man spake. And the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.
## 40.
But the Pharisees said, He casteth out the devils through the prince of the devils.
## 41.
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and disease among the people.
## 42.
But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
## 43.
Then said he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few.
## 44.
Pray ye, therefore, the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth laborers into his harvest.
