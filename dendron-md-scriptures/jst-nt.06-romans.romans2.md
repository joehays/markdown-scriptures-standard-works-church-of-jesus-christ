## 1.
Therefore, thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that thus judgest; for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
## 2.
But we are sure that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against them which commit such things.
## 3.
And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
## 4.
Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
## 5.
But, after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,
## 6.
Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
## 7.
To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory, and honor, and immortality, eternal life;
## 8.
But unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
## 9.
Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
## 10.
But glory, honor, and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.
## 11.
For there is no respect of persons with God.
## 12.
For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law; and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
## 13.
For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
## 14.
For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves,
## 15.
Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another,
## 16.
In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to the gospel.
## 17.
Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,
## 18.
And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law,
## 19.
And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,
## 20.
An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
## 21.
Thou, therefore, which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
## 22.
Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
## 23.
Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonorest thou God?
## 24.
For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
## 25.
For circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law; but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
## 26.
Therefore, if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
## 27.
And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?
## 28.
For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh;
## 29.
But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God.
