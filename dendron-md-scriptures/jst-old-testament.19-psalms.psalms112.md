[[Psalms111|<<-psalms-111]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms113|psalms-113]]ms113|Psalms 113 >>]]
## 1.
Praise ye the Lord. Blessed is the man who feareth the Lord and delighteth greatly in his commandments.
## 2.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth; the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
## 3.
Wealth and riches shall be in his house; and his righteousness endureth forever.
## 4.
Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness; he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.
## 5.
A good man showeth favor and lendeth; he will guide his affairs with discretion.
## 6.
Surely he shall not be moved forever; the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.
## 7.
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.
## 8.
His heart is established; he shall not be afraid until he see judgment executed upon his enemies.
## 9.
He hath dispersed; he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth forever; his horn shall be exalted with honor.
## 10.
The wicked shall see it and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth and melt away; the desire of the wicked shall perish.
