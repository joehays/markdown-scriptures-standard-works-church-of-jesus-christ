[[Psalms125|<<-psalms-125]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms127|psalms-127]]ms127|Psalms 127 >>]]
## 1.
When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
## 2.
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing. Then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.
## 3.
The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.
## 4.
Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south.
## 5.
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
## 6.
He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
