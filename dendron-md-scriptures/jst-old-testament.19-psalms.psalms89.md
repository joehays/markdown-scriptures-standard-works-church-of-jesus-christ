[[Psalms88|<<-psalms-88]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms90|psalms-90]]alms90|Psalms 90 >>]]
## 1.
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever; with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
## 2.
For I have said, Mercy shall be built up forever; thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.
## 3.
I have made a covenant with my chosen; I have sworn unto David, my servant,
## 4.
Thy seed will I establish forever and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.
## 5.
And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Lord\--thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.
## 6.
For who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord? Who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord?
## 7.
God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.
## 8.
O Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee, or to thy faithfulness round about thee?
## 9.
Thou rulest the raging of the sea; when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
## 10.
Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
## 11.
The heavens are thine; the earth also is thine; as for the world and the fullness thereof, thou hast founded them.
## 12.
The north and the south, thou hast created them; Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
## 13.
Thou hast a mighty arm; strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
## 14.
Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne; mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
## 15.
Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound; they shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance.
## 16.
In thy name shall they rejoice all the day, and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
## 17.
For thou art the glory of their strength; and in thy favor our horn shall be exalted.
## 18.
For the Lord is our defense; and the Holy One of Israel is our King.
## 19.
Then thou spakest in vision to thy Holy One and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
## 20.
I have found David, my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him,
## 21.
With whom my hand shall be established; mine arm also shall strengthen him.
## 22.
The enemy shall not exact upon him, nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
## 23.
And I will beat down his foes before his face and plague them that hate him.
## 24.
But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him; and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
## 25.
I will set his hand also in the sea and his right hand in the rivers.
## 26.
He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation.
## 27.
Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.
## 28.
My mercy will I keep for him forevermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
## 29.
His seed also will I make to endure forever and his throne as the days of heaven.
## 30.
If his children forsake my law and walk not in my judgments,
## 31.
If they break my statutes and keep not my commandments,
## 32.
Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.
## 33.
Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
## 34.
My covenant will I not break nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
## 35.
Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
## 36.
His seed shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before me.
## 37.
It shall be established forever as the moon and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.
## 38.
But thou hast cast off and abhorred; thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
## 39.
Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant; thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
## 40.
Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.
## 41.
All that pass by the way spoil him; he is a reproach to his neighbors.
## 42.
Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
## 43.
Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword and hast not made him to stand in the battle.
## 44.
Thou hast made his glory to cease and cast his throne down to the ground.
## 45.
The days of his youth hast thou shortened; thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.
## 46.
How long, Lord? Wilt thou hide thyself forever? Shall thy wrath burn like fire?
## 47.
Remember how short my time is. Wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?
## 48.
What man is he that liveth and shall not see death? Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.
## 49.
Lord, where are thy former loving-kindnesses which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?
## 50.
Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants\--how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people,
## 51.
Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O Lord\--wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
## 52.
Blessed be the Lord forevermore. Amen and amen.
