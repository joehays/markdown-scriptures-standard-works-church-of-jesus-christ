[[Psalms48|<<-psalms-48]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms50|psalms-50]]alms50|Psalms 50 >>]]
## 1.
Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world,
## 2.
Both low and high, rich and poor together.
## 3.
My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.
## 4.
I will incline mine ear to a parable; I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
## 5.
Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
## 6.
They that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches,
## 7.
None can by any means redeem his brother,
## 8.
Nor give to God a ransom for him that he should still live forever, that it ceaseth not forever to see corruption.
## 9.
For the redemption of their souls is through God\--and precious.
## 10.
For he seeth wise men die; likewise, the fool and the brutish person perish and leave their wealth to others;
## 11.
Their inward thought of their houses forever, their dwelling places to all generations. Lands they called after their own names, and they are honorable.
## 12.
Nevertheless, man in honor abideth not; he is also like the beasts that perish.
## 13.
This I speak of them who walk in their way and forsaketh the Almighty in their folly; yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.
## 14.
Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
## 15.
But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave, for he shall receive me. Selah.
## 16.
Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
## 17.
For when he dieth, he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him.
## 18.
Though while he lived he blessed his soul (and men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyself),
## 19.
He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.
## 20.
Man that is in honor and understandeth not is like the beasts that perish.
