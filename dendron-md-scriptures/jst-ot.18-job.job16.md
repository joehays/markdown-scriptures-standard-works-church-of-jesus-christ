## 1.
Then Job answered and said,
## 2.
I have heard many such things; miserable comforters are ye all.
## 3.
Shall vain words have an end? Or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
## 4.
I also could speak as ye do; if your soul were in my soul\'s stead, I could heap up words against you and shake mine head at you.
## 5.
But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief.
## 6.
Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged. And though I forbear, what am I eased?
## 7.
But now he hath made me weary; thou hast made desolate all my company.
## 8.
And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me; and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.
## 9.
He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me; he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
## 10.
They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.
## 11.
God hath delivered me to the ungodly and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.
## 12.
I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder; he hath also taken me by the neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.
## 13.
His archers compass me round about; he cleaveth my reins asunder and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.
## 14.
He breaketh me with breach upon breach; he runneth upon me like a giant.
## 15.
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and defiled my horn in the dust.
## 16.
My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death,
## 17.
Not for any injustice in mine hands; also, my prayer is pure.
## 18.
O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.
## 19.
Also, now behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.
## 20.
My friends scorn me; but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.
## 21.
Oh, that one might plead for a man with God as a man pleadeth for his neighbor!
## 22.
When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
