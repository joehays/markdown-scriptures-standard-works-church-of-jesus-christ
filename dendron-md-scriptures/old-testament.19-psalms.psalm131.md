## 1.
LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.
## 2.
Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.
## 3.
Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
