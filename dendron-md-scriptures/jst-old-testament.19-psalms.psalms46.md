[[Psalms45|<<-psalms-45]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms47|psalms-47]]alms47|Psalms 47 >>]]
## 1.
God is our refuge and strength, a present help in trouble.
## 2.
Therefore, we will not fear though the earth shall be removed and though the mountains shall be carried into the midst of the sea,
## 3.
And the waters thereof roar, being troubled, and the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.
## 4.
Yet there shall be a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most High.
## 5.
For Zion shall come, and God shall be in the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God shall help her right early.
## 6.
The heathen shall be enraged, and their kingdoms shall be moved; and the Lord shall utter his voice, and the earth shall be melted.
## 7.
The Lord of hosts who shall be with us, the God of Jacob, our refuge. Selah.
## 8.
Come behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he shall make in the earth in the latter days.
## 9.
He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire and saith unto the nations,
## 10.
Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the heathen; I will be exalted in the earth.
## 11.
The Lord of hosts shall be with us, the God of Jacob, our refuge. Selah.
