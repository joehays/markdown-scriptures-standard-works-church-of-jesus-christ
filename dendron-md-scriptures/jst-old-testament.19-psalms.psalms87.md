## 1.
His foundation is in the holy mountains.
## 2.
The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
## 3.
Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.
## 4.
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me; behold Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia; this man was born there.
## 5.
And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her; and the Highest himself shall establish her.
## 6.
The Lord shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah.

As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there; all my springs are in thee.
