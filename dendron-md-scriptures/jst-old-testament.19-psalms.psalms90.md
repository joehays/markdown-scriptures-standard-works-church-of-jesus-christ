[[Psalms89|<<-psalms-89]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms91|psalms-91]]alms91|Psalms 91 >>]]
## 1.
Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
## 2.
Before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
## 3.
Thou turnest man to destruction and sayest, Return, ye children of men.
## 4.
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night.
## 5.
Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep; in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
## 6.
In the morning it flourisheth and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down and withereth.
## 7.
For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.
## 8.
Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
## 9.
For all our days are passed away in thy wrath; we spend our years as a tale that is told.
## 10.
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
## 11.
Who knoweth the power of thine anger? Even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.
## 12.
So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
## 13.
Return us, O Lord. How long wilt thou hide thy face from thy servants and let them repent of all their hard speeches they have spoken concerning thee?
## 14.
Oh, satisfy us early with thy mercy, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
## 15.
Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us and the years wherein we have seen evil.
## 16.
Let thy work appear unto thy servants and thy glory unto their children.
## 17.
And let the beauty of the Lord, our God, be upon us; and establish thou the work of our hands upon us, yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
