## 1.
Thou, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
## 2.
And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
## 3.
Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
## 4.
No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.
## 5.
And if a man also strive for masteries, he is not crowned, except he strive lawfully.
## 6.
The husbandman that laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits.
## 7.
Consider what I say, and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.
## 8.
Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead, according to the gospel,
## 9.
Wherein I suffer trouble as an evildoer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.
## 10.
Therefore, I endure all things for the elect\'s sake, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
## 11.
For this is a faithful saying: If we be dead with him, we shall also live with him;
## 12.
If we suffer, we shall also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us;
## 13.
If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful; he cannot deny himself.
## 14.
Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.
## 15.
Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
## 16.
But shun profane and vain babblings; for they will increase unto more ungodliness.
## 17.
And their word will eat as doth a canker, of whom is Hymeneus and Philetus,
## 18.
Who, concerning the truth, have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.
## 19.
Nevertheless, the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal: The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
## 20.
But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honor, and some to dishonor.
## 21.
If a man, therefore, purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, and meet for the master\'s use, and prepared unto every good work.
## 22.
Flee also youthful lusts; but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
## 23.
But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.
## 24.
And the servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,
## 25.
In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves, if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth,
## 26.
And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.
