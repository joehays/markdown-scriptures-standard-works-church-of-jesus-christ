## 1.
But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.
## 2.
For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?
## 3.
And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice, having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.
## 4.
For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears, not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.
## 5.
But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part, that I may not overcharge you all.
## 6.
Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.
## 7.
So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.
## 8.
Wherefore, I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.
## 9.
For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.
## 10.
To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also; for if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgive I it in the person of Christ,
## 11.
Lest Satan should get an advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.
## 12.
Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ\'s gospel and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,
## 13.
I had no rest in my spirit because I found not Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.
## 14.
Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ and makest manifest the savor of his knowledge by us in every place.
## 15.
For we are unto God a sweet savor of Christ, in them that are saved and in them that perish;
## 16.
To the one, we are the savor of death unto death; and to the other, the savor of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
## 17.
For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
