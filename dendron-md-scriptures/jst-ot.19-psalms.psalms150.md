## 1.
Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in the firmament of his power.
## 2.
Praise him for his mighty acts; praise him according to his excellent greatness.
## 3.
Praise him with the sound of the trumpet; praise him with the psaltery and harp.
## 4.
Praise him with the timbrel and dance; praise him with stringed instruments and organs.
## 5.
Praise him upon the loud cymbals; praise him upon the high-sounding cymbals.
## 6.
Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.
