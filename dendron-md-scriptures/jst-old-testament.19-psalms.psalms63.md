[[Psalms62|<<-psalms-62]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms64|psalms-64]]alms64|Psalms 64 >>]]
## 1.
O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee; my soul thirsteth for thee; my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is,
## 2.
To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.
## 3.
Because thy loving-kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.
## 4.
Thus will I bless thee while I live; I will lift up my hands in thy name.
## 5.
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips,
## 6.
When I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches.
## 7.
Because thou hast been my help, therefore, in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
## 8.
My soul followeth hard after thee; thy right hand upholdeth me.
## 9.
But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
## 10.
They shall fall by the sword; they shall be a portion for foxes.
## 11.
But the king shall rejoice in God; everyone that sweareth by him shall glory; but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
