## 1.
Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such a high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
## 2.
A minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
## 3.
For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices; wherefore, it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
## 4.
Therefore, while he was on the earth, he offered for a sacrifice his own life for the sins of the people. Now every priest under the law must needs offer gifts, or sacrifices, according to the law,
## 5.
Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle; for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount.
## 6.
But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
## 7.
For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
## 8.
For, finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah\--
## 9.
Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt\--because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
## 10.
For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people;
## 11.
And they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
## 12.
For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
## 13.
In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.
