[[Psalms46|<<-psalms-46]] | [[jst-old-testament.[[Psalms48|psalms-48]]alms48|Psalms 48 >>]]
## 1.
Oh, clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.
## 2.
For the Lord most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth.
## 3.
He shall subdue the people under us and the nations under our feet.
## 4.
He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.
## 5.
God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.
## 6.
Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
## 7.
For God is the King of all the earth; sing ye praises with understanding.
## 8.
God reigneth over the heathen; God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.
## 9.
The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham; for the shields of the earth belong unto God; he is greatly exalted.
