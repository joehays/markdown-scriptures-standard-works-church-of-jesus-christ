## 1.
Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
## 2.
Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God;
## 3.
And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God; and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now it is already in the world.
## 4.
Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.
## 5.
They are of the world; therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.
## 6.
We are of God; he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
## 7.
Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.
## 8.
He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.
## 9.
In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his Only Begotten Son into the world that we might live through him.
## 10.
Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
## 11.
Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
## 12.
No man hath seen God at any time, except them who believe. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
## 13.
Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
## 14.
And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.
## 15.
Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
## 16.
And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.
## 17.
Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, so are we in this world.
## 18.
There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
## 19.
We love him because he first loved us.
## 20.
If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar; for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?
## 21.
And this commandment have we from him: That he who loveth God love his brother also.
