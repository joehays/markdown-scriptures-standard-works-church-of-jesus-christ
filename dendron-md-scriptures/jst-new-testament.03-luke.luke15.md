## 1.
Then drew near unto him many of the publicans and sinners to hear him.
## 2.
And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners and eateth with them.
## 3.
And he spake this parable unto them, saying,
## 4.
What man of you having a hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine and go into the wilderness after that which is lost until he find it?
## 5.
And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
## 6.
And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbors and saith unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.
## 7.
I say unto you that, likewise, joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons who need no repentance.
## 8.
Either, what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?
## 9.
And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and neighbors together, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost.
## 10.
Likewise, I say unto you, There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repenteth.
## 11.
And he said, A certain man had two sons;
## 12.
And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods which falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.
## 13.
And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.
## 14.
And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.
## 15.
And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
## 16.
And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks which the swine did eat; and no man gave unto him.
## 17.
And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father\'s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!
## 18.
I will arise, and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee,
## 19.
And am no more worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants.
## 20.
And he arose and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
## 21.
And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son.
## 22.
But the father said unto his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet,
## 23.
And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat and be merry;
## 24.
For this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.
## 25.
Now his elder son was in the field; and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.
## 26.
And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.
## 27.
And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound.
## 28.
And he was angry and would not go in; therefore, came his father out and entreated him.
## 29.
And he, answering, said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee; neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment; and thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends;
## 30.
But as soon as this thy son was come, who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.
## 31.
And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me; and all that I have is thine.
## 32.
It was meet that we should make merry and be glad; for this thy brother was dead and is alive again, was lost and is found.
